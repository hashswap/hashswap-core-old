## Installation

It is recommended that developers install the JavaScript client by making use
of the umbrella package `@zilliqa-js/zilliqa`. This takes care of bootstrapping the various modules, which are then accessible as members of$
`Zilliqa` class.

```shell
#Install package.json file using yarn to install @zilliqa-js/zilliqa, tslib and bn.js
yarn
```
